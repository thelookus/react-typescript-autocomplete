# react-typescript-autocomplete

This project is a simple autocomplete component for searching over a mocked data (it can be an externat API also) and highlighting the matched results.

It was built with React.js and Typescript.

No external libraries were used, except for styled components.

I implemented React Hooks with functional components only.

## Data

The dummy data used is a list of The Beatles albums, with a simple structure (id, year, title).

## Running

Just got to the `app` folder and run `npm start`, if don't see it yet, go to the `http://localhost:3000/` url in your favorite browser ;)

## Final words

Thank you for taking the time and review my code :)

Lucas.
